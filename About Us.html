		Who are we?
		<p>
		We are a group content creators founded by Not Skilled Here / Int3rnalFury and KillerBullet75 in February of 2018 
		to bring people together and enjoy each others' content as well as help each other grow!
		<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:125%;">
		What do we do?
		<p>
		We create content of many varieties and flavors. Youtube, Twitch, Soundcloud, Instagram, etc. 
		You name it, we likely have someone who is relatively active on that platform.
		<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:125%;">
		When do we come online or release content?
		<p>
		That's up to the creators!! Unfortunately all of us currently are in school and cannot afford yet to maintain a living from content creations yet. 
		However!!! As we grow and begin to be able to sustain ourselves with our content, we will individually come up with scheduled content! 
		<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:125%;">
		What does the future look like for us?
		<p>
		For now, we just wish to expand our individual reach and followings, but further down the line, 
		it would be cool to be able to create content that involves multiple members of the organization as travel is expensive and inconvenient.
		That being said, we do collaborate or overlap in content online sometimes so it is highly suggested that you follow multiple members to 
		see when content overlaps or interacts.
