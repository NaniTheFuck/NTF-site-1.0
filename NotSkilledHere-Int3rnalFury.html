		Howdy resident netizens,
		<p>
		I'm Albert from Dallas, Texas. I'm currently 21. 
		I am currently a junior (3rd year) attending Texas A&M University at College Station majoring in Technology Management. 
		<p>
		In life I am first and foremost a car enthusiast before I am anything else. 
		Closely followed by being an otaku and avid gamer. No Game No Life is my current favorite anime. 
		Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans takes a close second. 
		Other anime I like include Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Tokyo Ghoul, Initial D, and Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma among a plethora of others. 
		I have not cosplayed ever but wish to at some point. I do keep a running anime list in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. 
		<p>
		If you would like to see a complete list of anime I have watched and how much I liked them as well as in which order I watched everything, 
		you may download it here:
		<p>
		-<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rlon0o4ead5it3u/anime%20list.xlsx?dl=0" target="_blank">Anime List</a>
		<p>
		(It is directly updated from my computer so it will be updated every time I make a change to the list 
		so you may want to download it every so often if you wish to be constantly up to date on it.)
		<p>
		If you like the layout of my anime list and wish to use the same layout, 
		you are lucky since I have had requests and made it an empty template for people to download:
		<p>
		-<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0w7m2h018yqsmii/anime%20list%20template.xlsx?dl=0" target="_blank">Blank Anime List</a>
		<p>
		(A lot of the cells have formula's built in to calculate everything in the tables to the right. 
		If you wish to have additional columns added or have more ratings or something like that customized for yourself, 
		feel free to talk to me about it and I'll see what I can do. It's all FREE.)
		<p>
		Recently, I've been playing a lot of CSGO but otherwise I spend my time on Elsword. 
		Previous games I have been interested in have been the Halo series, Runescape, Warframe, Team Fortress 2, and Minecraft. 
		I have been occasionally streaming gameplay but wish to become more consistent. 
		On the other hand, I do quite a bit of Youtube as it is easier for me to edit and upload rather than find big blocks of hours to stream. 
		For the most part, my main channel consists of car related content. 
		On a side note, I travel all over Texas for car events so if you wanna hang and you are in Texas, feel free to hmu.
		<p>
		Other hobbies I have include heavily modifying Nerf guns, gunpla, and creating paper swords. 
		I also play the piano (15 years total including 7 years of lessons) and trombone (8 years). 
		Unfortunately I have had to give up most of these hobbies while I'm in college due to lack of desk space. 
		Hopefully I can return to these hobbies when I find more space or get a bigger desk to accommodate my hobbies.
		<p>
		My motto in life: Eat when you are hungry; sleep when you are tired. Spend as much of the remaining time enjoying life as you can.
		<p>
		Feel free to talk to me on any platform you find me on!! Nice to meet y'all and hope you enjoy my content!!! 
		<p>
		Regards,
		<p>
		Albert Weng
