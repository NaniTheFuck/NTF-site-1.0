		Welcome!!!
		<p>
		Welcome to the launch of our website!!! This is the easiest place for you to keep up with our content creators each on their own or all together!! 
		KillerBullet75 and I (Int3rnalFury / Not Skilled Here) founded this group with the intent to house a group of content creators (or artists) 
		in an environment where we can grow together and help each other with our own respective chosen paths. As such, it shouldn't be odd to find 
		pieces of each others' content in the content of another of our member's work. 
		<P>
		As we go along, we wish to be able to have more interaction between our members. We hope that you will follow all of us, or at least some of us, as we grow our own. In addition, you can expect us to bring in more members 
		to Nani The Fuck as well. I hope you will welcome them as they come! Feel free to email the address in the "Contact Us" section your suggestions 
		and thoughts.
		<p>
		This is just the beginning of our journey!
		<p>
		Sincerely,
		<p>
		Albert Weng (Int3rnalFury / Not Skilled Here)
